# Ames-Housing-Kaggle
## **Ames Housing**

This project is based on kaggle course and popular competition on advanced regression techniques.

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by _Dean De Cock._

## **Practice Skills**

- Creative feature engineering
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

- **Cleaning**
  - Data cleaning ,
  - Correlation plots ,
  - feature importance

- **Feature Selection Techniques**

Diifferent feature selection/elimination techniques:

    - Boruta ,
    - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE),
    - Mutual Information Score (Mi Scores),
    - Ridge regression,
    - BorutaShap (Boruta and Shap)

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Different methods of filling null values ,
  - ordinal encoding,
  - adding similar features (feature creation),
  - model feature importance plot

- **Feature Creation**
  - Little EDA (histograms, count plots, box plots)
  - Outlier detection using IQR
  - Adding similar features and handling rare values
  - Mutual info score plots and model feature importance plots

- **Mutual Info Junks**
  - Ordinal Encoding
  - Ordinal Encoding vs One Hot Encoding effect on RMSE
  - Mutual info plots

- **PCA and Kmean clusters**
  - Principal component Analysis
  - Feature creation with kmeans cluster
  - Feature creation with kmeans distance
